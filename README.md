# Java labs and assignments during school
Just a repo for my assignments during school, mainly data structures and algorithms

## Lab 1 & 2: Array Shenanigans
lab was focused on creating a dynamically allocated array (not actually dynamic since size doesn't change)

## Lab 3: Linear vs Binary search, Recursive vs Iterative
randomly generating an array of chars (a-Z) then performing binary and linear searches either recursively or iteratively based on user input

## Assignment 1: Library Catalogue system
having a primitive array of Book object, adding and removing

## Assignment 2: Extension of Assignment 1
added binary search for books, adding in order, file i/o
