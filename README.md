# Java labs and assignments during school
Just a repo for my assignments during school, mainly data structures and algorithms

## Lab 1 & 2: Array Shenanigans
lab was focused on creating a dynamically allocated array (not actually dynamic since size doesn't change)

## Lab 3: Linear vs Binary search, Recursive vs Iterative
randomly generating an array of chars (a-Z) then performing binary and linear searches either recursively or iteratively based on user input
